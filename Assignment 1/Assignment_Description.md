## Content: Introduction and Foundations
## Assignment: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Overview
Welcome to the Introduction to Machine Learning Class

In this assignment, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This assignment will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

In addition, you'll make sure Python is installed with the necessary packages to complete this assignment. There are two Python libraries, `numpy` and `pandas`, that we'll use a bit here in this assignment. Don't worry about how these libraries work for now -- we'll get to them in more detail in later assignments. 

## Software Requirements
This assignment uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

If you already have Python 3.6 installed on your computer, then you can install `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as "iPython") by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) on the command line. [This page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, you can install all the packages with the following command:

`sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter`

## Starting the Project

For this assignment, you can find the `titanic_survival_exploration` folder containing the necessary assignment files.

This assignment contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the assignment.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The assignment dataset. You?ll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the assignment. Do not modify.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the assignment files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the assignment. A **README** file has also been provided with the assignment files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the assignment.
